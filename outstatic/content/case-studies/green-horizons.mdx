Working with Core was a game-changer for us at Green Horizons. As a nonprofit focused on environmental conservation, we were struggling to meet our fundraising goals. The team at Impact Partners assessed our strategies and helped us revamp our approach with personalized donor communications, targeted campaigns, and improved online donation systems. Thanks to their expertise, we exceeded our fundraising targets by 30% in just six months, with a significant boost in recurring donations. Their support was invaluable in helping us increase donor engagement and achieve long-term financial sustainability.
