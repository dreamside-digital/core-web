# The Core Advantage

Core exists to address 2 major challenges in the non-profit sector: the decline in fundraising revenue across Canada and the shortage of professionals capable of addressing these gaps. \
\
As fewer Canadians embrace philanthropy, organizations are at risk of seeing their fundraising efforts plateau. This in turn impedes their ability to deliver essential programming. While alarming for the charitable sector, it is of most concern to the individuals and communities served by nonprofits. In the absence of robust, diversified revenue streams, organizations and the people they serve will always struggle to find stability. \
\
Traditional fundraising avenues are fraught with risk and uncertainty. The resources required to identify and retain qualified fundraisers are significant and their skillset is often limited to one channel of fundraising. On average, a fundraiser will spend only 18 months in their role before moving on to more lucrative opportunities. \
\
The gap created in their departure is enormous. The organization loses institutional knowledge and key relationships are damaged, both of which are essential to a successful fundraising program.\
\
At Core, we remove risk and uncertainty by delivering sustainable fundraising solutions. A dedicated, meticulous team is focused on raising funds for your mission, built on a foundation of integrity and collaboration. We will follow, and enhance, the direction and strategic vision of your organization.
