After completing a degree in Astrophysics at the University of Waterloo in 2006, I recognized that academics was not the path for me, and that I need to feel like I’m making a difference in my community through working directly with people in my community. 

Over the past 16 years of working in fundraising, I’ve not only worked with an extremely diverse set of organizations, but also a wide range of personalities and demographics of staff and donors alike. I pride myself in my ability to connect with individuals and to connect people with the organization I am representing. 

I have more than a decade of experience in leadership development, event planning, conference and workshop facilitation, and organizational strategic planning. I thrive in a fast paced environment, am (too) enthusiastic about data and metrics, and excel at change management. 

I grew up steeped in the world of NGOs and as a result have seen the incredible impact they can have and the real struggles that are present in growing and maintaining a charitable organization. Watching my father work with NGOs for his whole career, I was inspired to choose a path that allows me to feel I’ve truly done my best in my life to forward peace, justice, respect for others and respect for the earth.
