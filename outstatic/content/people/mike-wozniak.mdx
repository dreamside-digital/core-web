As a resource development professional, I apply my 13 years of fundraising experience to identify, cultivate, solicit, and steward major gifts from individuals, corporations, and foundations.

I've had the opportunity to engage in all levels of fund development from one time donations, monthly, direct mail, annual, legacy, event sponsorship and major gift giving.

I possess a proven track record of collaborating with Chief Development Officers, Executive Directors and various other stakeholders.

I am passionate about human rights and social justice, and I thrive in fast-paced, engaging environments. I also research and prepare written proposals and grant applications, implement and ensure donor recognition policies, and remain up-to-date on current trends and best practices in the field.

I have a proven ability to build strong, dynamic relationships with donors and stakeholders through excellent verbal and written communication skills. I am driven by the goal of securing major gifts that make a lasting impact on the lives of people who face fear and oppression every day.
