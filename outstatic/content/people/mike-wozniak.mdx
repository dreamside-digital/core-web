My journey in life has been unpredictable. Growing up in government housing in Toronto - 'the projects' - my neighbourhood was dominated by poverty, drug use and violence.Â  I never felt I was a bad person or that those around me were anything less than the people I saw in more affluent neighbourhoods. We were just different.
